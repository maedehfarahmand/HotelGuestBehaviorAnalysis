# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and data visualization using Power BI.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
    *   Visualizations and summary statistics are included in `EDA.ipynb`.

2.  **Machine Learning Models:**
    *   **Linear Regression:** Implemented to predict total sales based on independent features in `LinearRegression.ipynb`.
    *   **Clustering:** Applied clustering techniques to segment customer purchase behavior based on features such as monetary value, recency, and frequency of purchases, detailed in `Clustering.ipynb`.

3.  **Power BI Dashboard:**
    *   Created a visualization dashboard to present key insights derived from the clustered dataset in `PowerBIAnalysis.pbix`.
