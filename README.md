# Hotel Guest Behavior Analysis

This repository contains a portfolio project analyzing hotel guest behavior. The project encompasses exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and customer segmentation to gain insights into guest patterns and preferences.  It includes both a Python Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and machine learning, and a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization.

## Project Overview

*   `HotelAnalysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis process, including:
    *   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand data characteristics and identify trends.
    *   Random Forest Classification: A machine learning model to predict booking cancellations.
    *   K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm to segment customers based on their behavior.
*   `PowerBIAnalysis.pbix`: A Power BI dashboard providing interactive visualizations of the data analysis results and insights derived from the models.
